I have had an interview one of the [TradeCraft](www.tradecrafted.com) founders Misha which I think went really well, I have another interview tomorrow with Graham the lead Growth guy at Tradecraft.
Lying by a beautiful pool in Siem Reap, Cambodia brushing up on my Demand Generation knowledge is a wonderful way to spend the day.

Tradecraft is a full time in person training program for people that want to become awesome at ux designing, sales and business development or in my case growth hacking and join a network of people who are all world class in their fields so a very exciting opportunity!
