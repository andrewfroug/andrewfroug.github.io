Singapore! I have been here for close to 3 weeks not doing much just hanging out with my brothers at home and at the office.
I can see myself moving here in the future maybe next year for now for 2014 I will just visit.
Eating some amazing food Sabio's on a sunday all you can eat for $50 is amazing if a bit expensive for some one travelling Asia on the cheap. 
I've done well over the last week though only spending a little money that is not the answer of course it is better to make more money and live well than to cut back.
Reading a lot of material on starting a business
