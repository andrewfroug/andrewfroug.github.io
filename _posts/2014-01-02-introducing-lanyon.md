For this Ruby on Rails build you will get Ruby through Rbenv, Rails, OhMyZsh!, Git, iTerm, Sublime, Homebrew & Command Line Tools 

I am assuming that you have a fresh, clean install of OS X 10.9 Mavericks

Lets install everything we need

First we want command line tools

xcode-select -p


Thanks!
