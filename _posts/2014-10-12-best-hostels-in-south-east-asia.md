A list of the best hostels I stayed at in the select few places I went to in South East Asia

Kuta, Bali - CX Hostel Ground Zero in the biggest dorm very social

Bangkok, Thailand Lub D Hostel, Silom very social & friendly nice staff, Tuk tuk ride to Koh Sang Road but lots of cool places can be reached from here also the best burger place in the world is around the corner 25 degrees
Chiang Mai, Thailand Hug Hostel Very nice staff was just opening when I got there not packed but I can definitely see it becoming very social

Siem Reap, Cambodia, Mad Monkey Hostel, Very social you never want to leave the place has a pool a bar and a bar/restaurant and a 5 min walk to pub street and a corner store and pharmarcy outside also Mad Monkey branded Tuks Tuks outside the front door to take you to Angkor Wat and if you want to go volunteer in the soup kitchen and they organise a booze cruise in which you also conveniently see crocodiles.

Phnom Penh & Kampot, Cambodia also have a Mad Monkey's I am told they are great but haven't been there yet if you want a more local touch not the best places, price wise very reasonable for a dorm for a private room you can probably find somewhere cheaper, not as social though.
