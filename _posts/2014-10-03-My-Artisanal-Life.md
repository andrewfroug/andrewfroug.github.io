Let me tell you all about how my artisanal life will turn your life upside down

Now, this is the story all about how
My artisanal life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called S F

In Sonoma Valley, born and raised
In the kitchen is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all collectin' some truffles outside of the school

When a couple of cooks who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighbourhood
I gave one little review and my mom got scared
And said, "You're movin' with your ideals to cookery school in Francais"

I begged and pleaded with her the other day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it!"

First class, yo this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Paris are livin' like
Hmmm, this might be alright

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Sonoma

Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude look like a cop standin' wavin' my name out
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, nah forget it, yo home to S F

I pulled up to the restuarant about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby, "Yo homes, smell you later"
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of S F
