## Some Blogs and Podcasts Worth Checking Out in 2014



For over half a decade, one of my favorite daily rituals is opening up my RSS feed reader (what is RSS?) after my morning working session (along with the DC and Hacker News). Although my Feedly account currently has 300+ subscriptions, it’s not difficult to keep up with the content. I subscribe primarily to independent publishers who publish at maximum 4 or 5 articles a week. So as per the usual– I’m looking for more great blogs and online journeys to follow. I’m hoping that by sharing some of my favorites, and handful of you will be willing to share your favorite blogs in the comments.

Some of my friends just can’t seem to get over the fact that I don’t watch The Wire or go to the movies, but I’ve got a pretty serious book, blog, and podcast habit that I refuse to interfere with. I love blogs because you get to see ‘news’ happen on the ground. Why wait until Business Week picks up WP Curve’s story? Follow it as it unfolds. I also love interacting directly with publishers. Last week’s post (which I was a little worried about publishing, but no more after seeing the incredible responses) is a great example of this type of interaction– many of you, like me, have built a life and career around the people and projects we’ve found in the blogosphere.

So that brings me to today. Two and a half years ago, I put up a post outlining some of my favorite blog and podcasts. I’m going to update that list with some of my new found favorites, and I’ll also include a couple of old ones that have been really good lately.

A lot of TMBA favorites were intentionally left off the list (you know who you are) as I’ve been blogging for 5 years and mention folks all the time. So, ya know, all disclaimers– some of my very close friends and favorite blogs are left off of the list. I worked fast and pulled 60 URLs off the top of the pile.

I’ll focus here on the blogs that are somewhat TMBAish.

Anyway, the order is random too in the interest of time. Here goes…
